# Polynomials.jl

Polynomials.jl is a Julia package that provides basic arithmetic, integration,
differentiation, evaluation, and root finding over dense univariate polynomials.

To install the package, run

```julia
(v1.2) pkg> add Polynomials
```

The package can then be loaded into the current session using

```julia
using Polynomials
```

```@meta
DocTestSetup = quote
  using Polynomials
end
```

## Quick Start

### Construction and Evaluation

Construct a polynomial from its coefficients, lowest order first.

```jldoctest
julia> Polynomial([1,0,3,4])
Polynomial(1 + 3*x^2 + 4*x^3)
```

An optional variable parameter can be added.

```jldoctest
julia> Polynomial([1,2,3], :s)
Polynomial(1 + 2*s + 3*s^2)
```

Construct a polynomial from its roots.

```jldoctest
julia> fromroots([1,2,3]) # (x-1)*(x-2)*(x-3)
Polynomial(-6 + 11*x - 6*x^2 + x^3)
```

Evaluate the polynomial `p` at `x`.

```jldoctest
julia> p = Polynomial([1, 0, -1])
Polynomial(1 - x^2)

julia> p(1)
0

```

### Arithmetic

The usual arithmetic operators are overloaded to work on polynomials, and combinations of polynomials and scalars.

```jldoctest
julia> p = Polynomial([1,2])
Polynomial(1 + 2*x)

julia> q = Polynomial([1, 0, -1])
Polynomial(1 - x^2)

julia> 2p
Polynomial(2 + 4*x)

julia> 2 + p
Polynomial(3 + 2*x)

julia> p - q
Polynomial(2*x + x^2)

julia> p * q
Polynomial(1 + 2*x - x^2 - 2*x^3)

julia> q / 2
Polynomial(0.5 - 0.5*x^2)

julia> q รท p  # `div`, also `rem` and `divrem`
Polynomial(0.25 - 0.5*x)
```

Note that operations involving polynomials with different variables will error.

```jldoctest
julia> p = Polynomial([1, 2, 3], :x)
Polynomial(1 + 2*x + 3*x^2)

julia> q = Polynomial([1, 2, 3], :s)
Polynomial(1 + 2*s + 3*s^2)

julia> p + q
ERROR: Polynomials must have same variable
[...]
```

### Integrals and Derivatives

Integrate the polynomial `p` term by term, optionally adding constant
term `k`. The order of the resulting polynomial is one higher than the
order of `p`.

```jldoctest
julia> integral(Polynomial([1, 0, -1]))
Polynomial(1.0*x - 0.3333333333333333*x^3)

julia> integral(Polynomial([1, 0, -1]), 2)
Polynomial(2.0 + 1.0*x - 0.3333333333333333*x^3)
```

Differentiate the polynomial `p` term by term. The order of the
resulting polynomial is one lower than the order of `p`.

```jldoctest
julia> derivative(Polynomial([1, 3, -1]))
Polynomial(3 - 2*x)
```

### Root-finding

Return the roots (zeros) of `p`, with multiplicity. The number of
roots returned is equal to the order of `p`. By design, this is not type-stable,
the returned roots may be real or complex.

```jldoctest
julia> roots(Polynomial([1, 0, -1]))
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
  1.0
 -1.0

julia> roots(Polynomial([1, 0, 1]))
2-element Array{Complex{Float64},1}:
 -0.0 + 1.0im
  0.0 - 1.0im

julia> roots(Polynomial([0, 0, 1]))
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
  0.0
 -0.0
```

### Fitting arbitrary data

Fit a polynomial (of order `deg`) to `x` and `y` using a least-squares approximation.

```@example
using Plots, Polynomials
xs = range(0, 10, length=10)
ys = exp.(-xs)
f = fit(xs, ys)

scatter(xs, ys, label="Data");
plot!(f, extrema(xs)..., label="Fit");
savefig("polyfit.svg"); nothing # hide
```
